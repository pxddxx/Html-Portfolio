<p>This is the third out of the last four years I have participated in the Softie CAL, and it is one of my favorite crochet alongs to do. Mostly because stuffed animals/dolls/softies are some of my favorite things to crochet. The very first one I made my Dinosaur Softie, which is one of my favorite stuffed animals that I have ever made. I also made a Robot Softie, and a Flamingo.</p>

<p>When I made my dinosaur pattern a few years ago I immediately started thinking about the other things I could turn it into. A couple of years later I took that pattern, changed up a few things, and turned it into a Triceratops, which I might love even more than the original. Another thing that I wanted to make using the dinosaur pattern as a base was a dragon, and 4 years later I finally did it!</p>

<p>To make this dragon I used the dinosaur pattern for the body and the spikes, I changed up the coloration a little, not adding the contrasting color to the arms and legs. Then I added some little nostrils, a patch on the belly, horns on the head, and of course wings.</p>
